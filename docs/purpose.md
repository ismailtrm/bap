# Purpose
**Version:** 0.1 • **Updated:** 2025-09-16 11:26

We need to convincingly demonstrate that we are actively developing a compliant, safe, and performant air‑defense demo system aligned with the competition rules. The purpose of this repository is to provide **visible, verifiable artifacts**:
- Code that runs and shows detection/tracking and decision logic.
- Training scripts and **metrics** that prove model work (even starting with synthetic data).
- Safety mechanisms illustrated both in code (no‑fire mask) and in process (E‑Stop plan).
- Scoring automation that mirrors official rules to show we can maximize points.

These artifacts will feed our reports (OTR/KTR) and the capability videos.
