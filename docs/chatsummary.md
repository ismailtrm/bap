# Chat Summary (Working Notes for Agents)
**Updated:** 2025-09-16 11:26

- User requested a **fast, staged deliverable plan**: first write docs (for context to future agents), then generate Python code.
- We agreed to build a **“Show‑Your‑Work” evidence pack**:
  1) Docs: project summary, purpose, tasks, chat summary.
  2) Python: synthetic data generator; CV detection; YOLO train & inference; tracker; friend/foe; stage‑3 cue; score harness; simple UI.
- Emphasis on: **English comments in code**, conservative firing policy, accurate score/BSP computation, and neat short demo clips.
- Safety: software no‑fire mask + hardware E‑Stop planned.
- After docs are zipped, proceed with the Python starter pack.
